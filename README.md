Elero Python lib to the Home Assistant home automation platform
===============================================================

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a home automation platform running on Python 3. It is able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control.

This `elero` platform allows you to control different [Elero](https://www.elero.com) components/devices (such as venetian blinds, a roller shutters, tubular motors, electrical devices, rolling door drives, etc.).

# Prerequisite

The Elero Transmitter Stick is a 15-channel handheld radio transmitter for bidirectional communication between transmitter and receiver(s).

To use the receiver control of the Home Assistant, at least one receiver must be taught-in into the Elero Transmitter Stick. For further details of the learning procedure please visit the [Elero's Downloads webpage](https://www.elero.com/en/downloads-service/downloads/) and find the [Centero Operation instruction](https://www.elero.com/en/downloads-service/downloads/?tx_avelero_downloads%5Bdownload%5D=319&tx_avelero_downloads%5Baction%5D=download&cHash=5cf4212966ff0d58470d8cc9aa029066)

- **port:**
    - **description:** Name of the serial port to the Elero Transmitter Stick.
    - **required:** false
    - **type:** string
    - **default:** "/dev/ttyUSB0"
- **baudrate:**

    - **description:**  Enable parity checking.
    - **required:** false
    - **type:** string
    - **default:** "N"

If your device is plugged into the '/dev/ttyUSB0' of your board you do not have to configure anything just insert the following into the `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
elero:
```

In every other case:

Example of the port configuration:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
elero:
    port: '/dev/ttyUSB0'
```

Example of the full configuration:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
elero:
    port: '/dev/ttyUSB0'
    baudrate: 38400
    bytesize: 8
    parity: 'N'
    stopbits: 1
    read_sleep: 0.05
    read_timeout: 2.5
    write_sleep: 0.08
```

# Configuration of the Elero cover component

To enable an Elero component like a covers in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

- **name:**
    - **description:** Name of your cover device that is displayed on the UI.
    - **required:** true
    - **type:** string
    - **default:** -
    - **value:** your choose
- **channel:**
    - **description:** Channel number of the cover device which is learned on the Elero USB Stick.

    - **default:** -
    - **value:** one number between 1-15
- **device class:**
    - **description:** The class of the cover device, changing the device state and icon that is displayed on the UI.
    - **required:** true
    - **type:** string
    - **default:** -
    - **value:**
        - venetian blind
        - roller shutter
        - awning
        - rolling door
- **supported features:**
    - **description:** Functionalities of your cover device.
    - **required:** true
    - **type:** string
    - **default:** -
    - **value:**
        - up
        - down
        - stop
        - tilt
- **tilt mode:**
    - **description:** Your choose to how the tilt function works.
    - **required:** false
    - **type:** string
    - **default:** stepper
    - **value:**
        - stepper
        - continuous
- **tilt sleep:**
    - **description:** The seconds of the sleeping loop between the moves of the blinds.
    - **required:** false
    - **type:** float
    - **default:** 0.1

Example of a simple cover setup:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
    - platform: elero
      covers:
          bathroom_small:
              name: Shower
              channel: 1
              device_class: roller shutter
              supported_features:
                  - up
                  - down
                  - stop
```

## Configuration of the tilt functionality
The tilt can be configured as `stepper` or `continuous`.

**The `stepper` mode is the default mode.**

This mode means that every `tilt open` or `tilt close` command form the UI starts an open command after wait a second then starts a stop command.

The 'wait' can be configured with the `tilt sleep` parameter in seconds.

Example of a cover setup with stepper tilt functionality:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
    - platform: elero
      covers:
          childrenroom:
              name: George
              channel: 3
              device_class: venetian blind
              supported_features:
                  - up
                  - down
                  - stop
                  - tilt
              tilt_mode: stepper
              tilt_sleep: 0.08
```

The `continuous` mode means that the blades moves continuously after the 'tilt open' command up to the 'tilt stop' command.

Example of a cover setup with continuous tilt functionality:
```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
    - platform: elero
      covers:
          childrenroom:
              name: George
              channel: 3
              device_class: venetian blind
              supported_features:
                  - up
                  - down
                  - stop
                  - tilt
              tilt_mode: continuous
```

## Cover groups
To create `Cover Groups` in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
cover:
    - platform: group
      name: "All Cover"
      entities:
          - cover.shower
          - cover.george
```

---

# Installation of the lib
Just copy the contents of the `custom_components` folder into your Home Assistant `../config/custom_components/` folder.

Configurate your `/config/configuration.yaml` file and its all linked files like `covers` and `groups`, etc. what you did and filled. Restart your Home Assistant server and enjoy.

## Example config files
You can find my example files in the 'config' folder as a starting point for your Elero platform and component setup like a cover.

---------------

# Automation

It is possible to specify triggers for automation of your covers.

```yaml
# Example automations.yaml entry
# Covers
    - alias: 'Close the covers before sunset'
      trigger:
        platform: sun
        event: sunset
        offset: '+00:30:00'
      action:
        service: cover.close_cover
        entity_id: cover.all_Cover
```
---

# Waiting for implementation

- tilt handling (ongoing)
- set position up-down, tilt
- intermediate positions handling
- ventilation / turning positions handling
- more than one usb transmitter handling

# Known issues:

- tilt functionality is in alpha state
    - tilt open and close should be control only the blades mouvements
    - continous mode:  the shutter closes completely
